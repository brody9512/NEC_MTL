### Comments ###
- dataset --> train_dataset & test_dataset
- losses --> only using diceloss, dicebceloss, and uptask loss
- segmentation and classification both for train but only classification for test
- save_dir + saving and loading logic ==> revisit after finishing PCG refactoring
- model figure = extract from supplements and send it to me (request brody and remind him)
- model metrics at the end of readme.md = use figure 1 from supplements
- implement gradcam if time allows (if possible)
